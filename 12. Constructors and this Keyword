// Creating a person Constructor
function Person(name, dob) {
  this.name = name;
  // this.age = age;
  this.birthday = new Date(dob);
  this.calculateAge = function() {
    const diff = Date.now() - this.birthday.getTime();
    const ageDate = new Date(diff);
    return Math.abs(ageDate.getUTCFullYear() - 1970);
  }
}

// After creating a constructor function we can instantiate the variable.

// Instantiating the person varibale.
// To instantiate we create a new keyword.
const pradeep = new Person("Pradeep", 21);
const john = new Person("John", 36);

console.log(john);

const pradeep = new Person("Pradeep", "3-2-2000");

console.log(pradeep.calculateAge());
